# SignalRGB Custom Plugin Placement Guide

To add custom plugins for **SignalRGB**, you need to place your plugin files in the appropriate directory. 

Custom plugins should be placed in the **User Directory** to ensure SignalRGB can load them properly. By default, this directory is in one of the following locations:


- If using **local storage**:
C:\Users[YOUR USERNAME]\Documents\WhirlwindFX\Plugins


- If using **OneDrive** (common in synced setups):
C:\Users[YOUR USERNAME]\OneDrive\Documents\WhirlwindFX\Plugins

---

## Steps to Add a Custom Plugin

1. Create a folder for your plugin inside the user-made directory (e.g., `MyCustomPlugin`).
2. Add your plugin files (`plugin.js`, `manifest.json`, etc.) to this folder.
3. Restart **SignalRGB** to load your plugin.

By placing your custom plugins in the **User Directory**, you ensure SignalRGB can safely access and load them, keeping built-in plugins intact.
